# DIGIBHEM
This project focuses on developing an image classification model utilizing deep learning techniques. The main objective is to accurately classify images into predefined categories. Implemented in Python, the project makes use of powerful libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV for model development and training.
The project involves comprehensive data preprocessing steps, including image resizing, normalization, and augmentation to improve model performance and generalization capabilities. The model architecture is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are known for their effectiveness in image recognition tasks. The architecture is designed to be flexible, allowing customization and fine-tuning according to the specific dataset used.
For training and validation, the project incorporates advanced techniques like data augmentation, learning rate scheduling, and early stopping to optimize the training process and prevent overfitting. Evaluation of the model is thorough, with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score provided to assess performance.
The project is demonstrated using the [Dataset Name] dataset, consisting of [Number of Images] images across [Number of Classes] classes, where each class represents a distinct category for classification.
